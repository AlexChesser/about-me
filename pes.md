## Api Systems

API Systems encompasses two core areas, the Netflix API and Products’ Edge.  The Netflix API enables signup, content discovery, and partner experiences on 1000+ device types. The team creates a unified abstraction and aggregation layer over disparate Netflix mid-tier systems, enabling device teams to build innovative user experiences through a consistent API layer.  The Products’ Edge focuses on applications behind the scenes that power a variety of our internal workflows.  An example is Studio Edge, an unified GraphQL API that is federated across 60+ backend services and powers our entire content engineering workflow from pitch to play utilized by Netflix employees, vendors, contractors and creative talent.

Org Responsibilities:
* Expose a singular API to client devices to navigate our Netflix experience
* Maintain an end-to-end development workflow for our APIs and providing multiple entry points into our core aggregation layer
* Maintain a massively scalable, resilient API aggregation layer that 

### Netflix API Team

aka: DNA

This team focuses on building the aggregation tier that stitches together hundreds of backend services and libraries into a single unified data model and schema.  This is then materialized in a variety of ways, through REST APIs, our custom Groovy execution engine (.NEXT), Graph based API (DNA API) and soon to be GraphQL.  The team manages a complex dependency pipeline and sophisticated data model, and operates a Tier 1 service at Netflix.

### Federated API Gateway Team

aka: BFG

This team develops a scalable API platform that accommodates rapid iteration across mid-tier and backend teams while providing a unified, discoverable API to clients.  The current scope includes the GraphQL gateway, schema registry and federation sdk.   Our current focus areas are Studio Edge, the unified GraphQL API for our content/studio applications and Consumer Edge, unifying our MemberUIs (TVUI, Web, iOS, and Android) on a single GraphQL API.  Additionally, our team is a key contributor to advancing GraphQL adoption across Netflix.
