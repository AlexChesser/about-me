## Api Systems

```To enable rapid evolution and reliable product experiences across consumer and studio via resilient API orchestration layers and engaged partner interactions ```

This team builds the API Orchestration layer at Netflix.  This powers our consumer and studio products.  Consumer side handles 2M RPS and connects 1000+ devices to the hundreds of mid-tier services we have.  On the studio side, we are modernizing the content production process from "pitch to post" and it is very data intensive and based on a GraphQL federation architecture (which we're pioneering with Apollo).
