# People Leadership

For the first 10 years of my career, I focused on software development and worked as an individual contributor (Java, Python, RoR).  I then became more of a "player/coach", where I was still hands-on but also led small teams.  And since then, I've held various leadership positions.  For awhile, I wasn't sure if I wanted to leave hands-on development so I joined smaller companies where I could lead people and still code (Golang and Elixir/Phoenix).  However, in my last 3 roles, I've focused more on people leadership and have grown to really appreciate it.  The thing is, being a people leader takes as much practice and work as becoming a strong technical IC; it really is a totally different career path.  Here are some key areas you'll need to focus on as a people leader.

## Creating and/or sustaining the culture

```Culture is ultimately defined by the desired behaviors that leadership clearly and consistently communicates and then holds themselves and their employees accountable towards.```

So what behaviors do you want to model?  What is your leadership philosophy?  A team or company's culture is set at the top and then realized by the individuals.  Thus, it's critical to come up with your own [philosophy](https://github.com/batmany13/about-me#leadership-philosophy) and then create a set of behaviors that model that philosophy and then hold your team accountable for it.  You have to hire, grow and let go of people based on it to really reinforce it.

## Growing People

I took a [management development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i9ZCQmXaVpOEJGKwi8lFoklPLm3vZkj_/view) program and it focused on the 4 key capabilities that define great managers:

* Coaching
* Feedback
* Productivity and Prioritization
* Effective 1x1s

I won't be able to effectively communicate all the lessons and learnings from this multi-day, multi-hour lesson plan, but suffice to say, these are definitely the four areas that really matter when leading people.  Coaching, feedback and effective 1x1s are all sort of tied together, and I consider this the core to growing people.  1x1s are where the coaching and feedback takes place, and being able to "coach" instead of "tell" will help drive autonomy and learning.  Feedback is central to it all because if you can't give specific, timely feedback for positive and negative things, its going be hard to grow anyone.  Finally, productivity and prioritization is something you as a leader will have to do but also make sure your teams does well, and this really will help them execute effectively on projects.

## Hiring People

This is the entire process of finding talented people that can be effective at a specific role within your organization.  It takes a lot of work, and in many organizations is considered the most critical thing a people leader does.  Some people falsely assume that HR or Recruiting will just do this for you, but in reality, the burden is on the hiring manager (and the team) to do the work.  Below are the steps you need to do well to hire well

* Define
* Source
* Recruit
* Interview
* Onboard

## Finding the right fit for people

This might be an euphemism for firing someone, but it really comes down to fit and timing.  If you've spent the time vetting people and then growing them, it is unlikely that they are incapable of doing the work, but more likely struggling with the specific role or the organization and culture.  Or maybe something in their personal life has changed, and its made it difficult for them to execute the way they used to.  In the end, doing this the right way, making sure proper, direct feedback and coaching have been given and then doing it in a timely and just manner is best.  It will undoubtably be unpleasant and wear on you, but making sure people end up at the right place is the best for them, and your team and of course yourself.  I still find this the hardest thing to do as a people leader and something I'll never get used to (and probably shouldn't).
