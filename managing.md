# People Leadership

For the first 10 years of my career, I focused on software development and worked as an individual contributor (Java, Python, RoR).  I then became more of a "player/coach", where I was still hands-on but also led small teams.  And since then, I've held various leadership positions.  For awhile, I wasn't sure if I wanted to leave hands-on development so I joined smaller companies where I could lead people and still code (Golang and Elixir/Phoenix).  However, in my last 3 roles, I've focused more on people leadership and have grown to really appreciate it.  The thing is, being a people leader takes as much practice and work as becoming a strong technical IC; it really is a totally different career path.  Here are some key areas you'll need to focus on as a people leader.

## Creating and maintaining the culture

``` “Culture is ultimately defined by the desired behaviors that leadership clearly and consistently communicates and then holds themselves and their employees accountable towards.”``

So what behaviors do you want to model?  What is your leadership philosophy?  A team or company's culture is set at the top and then realized by the individuals.  Thus, it's critical to come up with your own [philosophy](https://github.com/batmany13/about-me#leadership-philosophy) and then create a set of behaviors that model that philosophy and then hold your team accountable for it.  You have to hire, grow and let go of people based on it to really reinforce it.

## Growing People

I took a management course which focused on the 4 key capabilities of highly effective people leaders, they are:

* Coaching
* Feedback
* Productivity and Prioritization
* Effective 1x1s

## Recruiting and Hiring

## Finding the right fit for people

This could mean in a different team or a team company
