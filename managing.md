# People Leader

For the first 10 years of my career, I focused on software development and worked as an individual contributor (Java, Python, RoR).  I then became more of a "player/coach", where I was still hands-on but also led small teams.  And since then, I've held various leadership positions.  For awhile, I wasn't sure if I wanted to leave hands-on development so I joined smaller teams where I could lead people and still code (Golang and Elixir/Phoenix).  However, in my last 3 roles, I've focused more on people leadership and have grown to really appreciate it.  The thing is, being a people leader takes as much practice and work as becoming a strong technical IC, so here are some basics on what makes a good people leader.

## Creating the culture

## Growing People

I took a management course which focused on the 4 key capabilities of highly effective people leaders, they are:

* Coaching
* Feedback
* Productivity and Prioritization
* Effective 1x1s

## Recruiting and Hiring

## Finding the right place for people

This could mean in a different team or a team company
