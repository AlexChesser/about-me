# About me

My name is [Bruce Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/batmany13/) and I've been in various software development and leadership roles.  I am currently an Engineering Director @ Netflix in the PES (Product Edge Systems) group leading the API systems team (DNA and Studio).

This is a guide to my leadership philosophy and a little about me.

## My Leadership Philosophy

<img width=50% height=50% src=https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5c682520f6d8a07482e12970/1078x765/d21d65a8818d6d392c3e27e69fd699e3/image.jpeg.jpg>

```Create a learning environment by promoting psychological safety, autonomy and transparency.  Teams should have a purpose, and a growth mindset and a perpensity for action and delivering customer value.```

## About Me Personally

### I care deeply about the whole self

I think "caring" is so important, I wrote an [article](https://goshippo.com/blog/caring-makes-an-engineering-organization/) about it.  It's not just that I care about you as a person, your history and your growth but I also care that I create an environment to allow your caring to flourish.  There is a concept of "discretionary effort" and I believe caring about what you do is what drives the most of it out of people.

### I like trying new ideas all the time

I am an entrepreneuer at heart which means I love ideas and know implementing them is the only way to know if it'll actually work.  Thus, I learn towards action and executing.  I might read an article, synthesize the learnings and then apply the concepts the very next day (I consider this my superpower).  Its not that I am "fickle", its I want to see if I can apply what I learn.  And if I see something works, I'll continue to use and refine it.

### I am transparent about work and my own fallibility

I believe sharing information is the key to our success.  I think the only way we can act with autonomy is to have all the necessary information to make decisions.  This also bleeds into who I am as a person, and I am fairly an open book and am very comfortable with being vulnerable and saying "I don't know".

I adapted the above from the [Finding my ideal leader exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4DSgLhlAS2ods_mVqBh8v-55zPRjshBSkfmojmlz2A/edit) I did.

### What past bosses have said about me

My current boss @ Netflix did a reference check on me, but only after he offered me the job and for the express purpose to see how he can enable me to succeed.  His checks and the response he sent me was so telling and accurate, I thought I'd put it here.

From PK
* Encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, balance with prioritization and honing what to focus on now vs later
* Coach on when to make the call on someone not working out in their role versus continuing to try and grow them

From DW
* He's most effective when he's a player coach. Bruce is best when he gets to roll up his leaves, get into the codebase, one of the best debuggers he has seen.
* Bruce just needs to be oriented and supported and then get out of his way. He's a doer, doesn't do well with a lot of bureaucracy. Focus him on execution.

From ST
* Bruce's super power is his contagious optimism. What many thought of as risks Bruce reframed as opportunities.
* Growth area is to be open with your critiques.
