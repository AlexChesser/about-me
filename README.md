# About me

My name is [Bruce Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/batmany13/) and I've been in various software development and management roles.  I am currently an Engineering Director @ Netflix in the PES (Product Edge Systems) group leading the API systems team (DNA and Studio).

This is a guide to my leadership philosophy and a little about me.

## Leadership Philosophy

<a href="https://peakon.com/blog/workplace-culture/psychological-safety/"><img width=50% height=50% src=rsrc/learning_zone.jpg></a>

```Create a learning environment by promoting psychological safety, autonomy and transparency. Teams should have a clear purpose, a growth mindset, and a propensity for action and delivery of customer value.```

### Start with safety

Everything begins and ends with psychological safety.  Without it, people will lack caring, be disengaged, aloof, standoffish or downright scared.  But that's not the worst of it, you won't get the ideas, the diversity of thought, the meaningful discussions between the team and lose out on all the benefits of hiring talented people.

Toolbelt: Model Vulnerability and ask a lot of questions.  Encourage discussions from all members of the team, hire for diversity and inclusion.  No tolerance for brilliant jerks.

### Set a purpose

No matter the size of team, setting a purpose and having a vision of what you want is really important.  It's the sense of direction that people want, will energize the team and most importantly, serve as a guidepost on what you should and shouldn't be working on.

Toolbelt: Team mission exercise, identify ["3 uniques"](https://blog.eosworldwide.com/blog/96514/traction-thoughts/uniques/) of the team

### Share with the team openly

Information is not a weapon to use or to hoard but a powerful unifier that unlocks your teams autonomy and building value for your customers.  This means sharing data good or bad, talking about issues openly so that you can invite people to work together to solve them.  Don't hide or shield your team, be open about whats going on, they'll figure it out anyways.  

Toolbelt: Have meetings and lunches together, talk about what's going on in an informal setting.  Use [1x1s](1x1s.md) to open up to each other.

### Reward empowered learning

Giving your team autonomy, which is agency over their decisions and having "[freedom and responsibility](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)" is very critical to their success.  But what's just as important is giving the time and space for it.  If you're too focused on executing towards a deadline, you might not have any time or room for learning and trying new things.  Finally, celebrate the learnings, don't frame them as "failures" but as learnings to do better and more next time.  A growth mindset comes with its own investments!

Toolbelt: Try Kanban, limit your work in progress and focus on quality and shipping not an arbitrary deadline.  Celebrate wins and learnings!  Use post mortems to diagnosis incidents and learn from them.

### Measure your goals

Having goals and making progress against them is great.  It will tell you how you're doing individually and as a team.  It also allows you to prioritize and know if you're doing the right thing.

Toolbelt: Use OKRs (objectives and key results) to focus the team and track your progress

## About Me Personally

<img src=rsrc/bat_signal.jpg>

I adapted this from the [Finding my ideal leader exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4DSgLhlAS2ods_mVqBh8v-55zPRjshBSkfmojmlz2A/edit) I did.

### I care deeply about how much you care

I think "caring" is so important, I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@batmany/caring-makes-or-breaks-an-engineering-organization-5431fdad3327) about it.  It's not just that I care about you as a person, your background and your growth but I also care that I create an environment to allow your caring to flourish.  There is a concept of "discretionary effort" and I believe caring about your company, teammates and yourself is what drives the most of it out of people.

### I like to try new ideas frequently

I am an entrepreneuer at heart which means I love trying out new ideas and see if it'll actually work.  Thus, I lean towards action and executing.  I might read an article, synthesize the learnings and then apply the concepts the very next day (I consider this my superpower).  It's not that I am fickle, I just want to see if I can apply what I learn quickly.  And if an idea works, I will continue to iterate and refine it over time.

### I am transparent about work and my own fallibility

I believe sharing information is the key to our success.  I think the only way we can act with autonomy is to have all the necessary information to make decisions.  This also bleeds into who I am as a person, and I am an open book and am very comfortable with being vulnerable and saying "I don't know" or "I messed up".

### I am an eternal optimist and like creating a fun environment

I like to create a fun environment because what we do can be pretty stressful.  I enjoy building a jovial rapport with my team, and spark joy in their work.  I am also an eternal optimist so difficult situations at work doesn't get me down and I always look for a positive light.  While many people think I am an outgoing fun-loving extrovert, I am really an introvert (or maybe ambivert) and enjoy being alone every so often to re-charge.

### I like to ask why

I need to reconcile what I (or the team) is doing with the company or team's mission.  Values means something to me, and I like to know why I am doing anything.  If there's dissonance between values/goals/mission and actual actions, I will push back.  I also like to understand underlying assumptions of any project and determine if we're achieving the benefits we set out to gain.

### What past bosses have said about me

My current boss @ Netflix did a reference check on me, but only after he offered me the job and for the express purpose to see how he can enable me to succeed.  He sent me a summary of responses from my former bosses and they were so telling and accurate, I thought I'd put it here.

From PK
* Encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, balance with prioritization and honing what to focus on now vs later
* Coach on when to make the call on someone not working out in their role versus continuing to try and grow them

From DW
* He's most effective when he's a player coach. Bruce is best when he gets to roll up his leaves, get into the codebase, one of the best debuggers he has seen.
* Bruce just needs to be oriented and supported and then get out of his way. He's a doer, doesn't do well with a lot of bureaucracy. Focus him on execution.

From ST
* Bruce's super power is his contagious optimism. What many thought of as risks Bruce reframed as opportunities.
* Growth area is to be open with your critiques.
