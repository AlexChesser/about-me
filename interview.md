## Interview Process

It is important to have a process, that is uniform and allow different interviewers to evaluate disparate candidates appropriately.  It is important to think of interviews as pieces filling a jigsaw puzzle.  Each interview should further clarify the view of a candidate.  As a candidate advances in the interview, no one single interview may sink the candidancy and it only provides more information.  Utimately, the decision will be on the hiring manager (hence the offer decision) to decide if the candidate would fit given all the things you know about them.

### Netflix API Systems

This process is specific to API Systems, and will vary across different API system teams

* RPS - chat with recruiter, talk about position, learn more about how you approach things and past experiences
* MPS - chat with hiring manager, will build off of RPS conversation, drill down on technical experience and how you work within a team
* TPS - Either a take home or a technical phone screen related to the take home, will be equally evaluated.  If the take home meets expectations, we will have a follow up call (originally part of onsite 1 but pulled forward)
* Onsite 1
  * Technical Screen 1
  * Technical Screen 2
  * RPS Follow-up - additional insights into what you're looking for and how you think about our culture
  * MPS Follow-up - will focus on a specific scenarios and how you'd deal with it
* Onsite 2
  * Leader Follow up - usually hiring manager's manager
  * HRBP - business partner additional screen around motivations, culture thoughts
* Offer Decision - analysis of what are the strengths, risks, type of ramp up needed, resources available and other considerations for hiring or not.
