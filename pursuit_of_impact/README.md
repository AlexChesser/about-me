## Pursuit of Impact Tips

### Designing your team

Tips to help achieve true clarity

* Ensure there’s [safety](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it) for issues to be debated openly
* Be intellectually curious, ask probing questions to drill deeper in your understanding of how things work, e.g. “what’s holding us back”? 
* Be empathetic to your team and their challenges but be careful that your curiosity doesn’t turn interrogatory 
* [Create margin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/creating-margin-karen-casella) for yourself and ruthlessly prioritize your time.  Do not try to do everything.  Push back on your calendar commitments and set aside [“X days”](https://fortune.com/2020/06/29/winning-now-winning-later-author-david-cote-on-his-secret-to-corporate-creativity/) for free thinking.
* Map today's landscape of team member strengths and growth areas.  Spend extra time with each team member, have them “onboard” you in their respective areas.
* Pull information from a variety of sources including your partners, your peers, your boss, and past team members. Review the previous team charter and documentation.
* Analyze what qualities would enable your team to go to the next level.  Some qualities may not be initially obvious so take your time to suss this out.

### Hiring stunning colleagues

* View each interview as a piece to a puzzle.  Don’t take any single high praise or low score without considering the overall context.
* Have a clear hiring decision making model, whether it solely up to the hiring manager, by a committee, or team consensus.
* Source with intention.  Based on your findings in your design phase, determine the right set of skills, both technical and non-technical, that you need for your team
* Own your process and make sure you are clear what each interviewer is gathering. Each bit of information will help fill the puzzle
* Have a clear and crisp pitch for your role.  You should be able to articulate exactly what the new hire would be working on when they start and how you plan to grow their impact in the role.
* Create a hiring decision doc to answer questions like what they bring to the team and what you would need to coach them on.  This will sharpen your thinking on what you are looking for and how that person aligns with that.
* Go beyond your own network  and reach out to folks that you may not typically talk to or are familiar with.  Building a diverse pipeline is how you can find your next stunning hire
* Stamp out inadvertent biases in your process.  This could be anything from sourcing from a limited pool to having technical interviews that bias towards people with more free time.  Ensure that it is [fair and equitable](https://hbr.org/2017/06/7-practical-ways-to-reduce-bias-in-your-hiring-process)

### Creating a learning environment

* Have a clear onboarding plan for new hires.  Set reasonable targets and provide time and space for someone to ramp up.  Frame it as a path to comfortability vs a set  of tasks to finish
* Build a team guide or [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).  It’s important to keep this up to date as your processes evolve.  
* Again, [create margin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/creating-margin-karen-casella/) for your team to learn and grow.  Ensure your roadmap gives sufficient time for learning initiatives. You must prioritize this equally to product requests and infra changes.
* Pair program!  Using something like [Tuple](https://tuple.app/) can make it easy for your developers to learn and grow together.
* Document major technical and organizational changes with something like [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments).  This allows you to memorialize the changes in your team and invites all to comment and dissent.
* Normalize trying new things.  Make sure you experiment with new techniques for your teams to learn. Make failures a learning opportunity so your next initiative will improve.
