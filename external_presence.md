### Micro-networking Events

I've also done various sessions around APIs, Culture with various copmanies, these are more intimate settings and having detailed conversations with companies.

### Copmany Github Pages

I've also built github pages at Brightergy, Synq.fm, Packet and Shippo.  These were team culture pages which highlighted how the team works or behaves together.
