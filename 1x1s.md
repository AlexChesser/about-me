# 1x1s

1x1s is the most important tool for a people leader.  There are actually several kinds I employ to build strong, lasting relationships and help grow my teammates (and myself).

## Getting to know you

Whenever I take on a new team or hire a new employee, I use this.  I consider this a very special 1x1 because its when you can make your first impression as a leader and set the tone for the relationship moving forward.  I always come from a place of caring of the whole self, so this is more about getting to know you the person and what makes you tick.

* What's your origin story?  How did you get into technology?  What's your favorite thing about it?  What do you not like?
* What's your role here?  What do you work on specifically?  What do you enjoy, what don't you like?
* If you think the team could change one thing, what would it be?  (This will need to be a real answer, not "better coffee" :D)
* How do you like to receive feedback? - For instance: immediately in person, or email first and then in person or some other way
* What's your favorite way to celebrate as a team? (i.e. dinner with team, wine tasting, bowling, bocce etc)
* How do you like to be recognized as an individual?  In front of the team, through a celebration, personally in private, special personalized gift?
* When do you like to do 1x1s?  Morning, afternoon, any particular days you prefer, Monday vs Friday?
* Do you have hobbies outside of work?
* What's your favorite food, any particular restaurants you like that serves it?
* What's your favorite dessert?

## Recurring

These are usually weekly, same time, same day, typically 45-60 mins and saved for direct reports.  The direct report should bring the agenda as its a way to cover relevant topics.  However, I do have a sample format I use that typically helps guide the conversation and focus in on key things.  This should be considered "sacred" and not to be moved or changed unless either party is on vacation.

### Sample Format

* Check in
  * Did you do anything fun last week?
  * what did you work on last week that made you happy?
  * What drained your energy or annoyed you?
* Goals Update (for example OKR check-ins)
  * How is the work driving KRs?
  * Are there other things you think we should work on?
* Feedback
  * What are things I am doing that is helping you do your job?
  * What are things I am doing that is hindering you?
* Development Plan Progress
  * What did you work on last week that helped with your development plan?
  
## Skip Levels

This only applies to leaders who have more than one layer of management.  So if you manage managers, its important to do skip levels every so often.  It helps you get closer to the action and understand whats working or not working with the specific teams.  It also lets you build rapport with people so it doesn't seem like you're on some pedestal.

## Development Plan / Career Growth

Typically this is done every 6 months.  Some like to do this as part of 1x1s, but I like to dedicate an hour or more for this.  What you could do is just replace one 1x1 to focus purely on this topic.  This is the development plan with the individual.  Once again, this is driven by the individual and its their plan, not yours.  So, you want to encourage growth in areas that they would be interested in.  You could bring up areas that are hindering their growth in the organization as improveent areas, but still should be driven by the individual.  I've used the below sample format to help encourage people to think openly about their plan.

* What are you good at that you want to keep on getting good at? 
* What are you interested in learning that you don't know already?
* What makes you uncomfortable or worried about learning? - examples: public speaking, networking, giving critical feedback
* Pick 2-3 things from the above list that you want to get good at.
  * Set "key results" for those goals and figure out what you will do specifically to help acheive those.  So take an example of "I want to get better at giving critical feedback".  How will you improve this?  Are there specific classes you will take?  Who would you like to try it on first?  How is your critical feedback responses been?
