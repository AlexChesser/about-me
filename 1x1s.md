# 1x1s

1x1s is the most important tool for a people leader.  There are actually several kinds I employ to build strong, lasting relationships and help grow my teammates (and myself).

## Getting to know you

Whenever I take on a new team or hire a new employee, I use this.  I consider this a very special 1x1 because its when you can make your first impression as a leader and set the tone for the relationship moving forward.  I always come from a place of caring of the whole self, so this is more about getting to know you the person and what makes you tick.

* What's your origin story?  How did you get into technology?  What's your favorite thing about it?  What do you not like?
* What's your role here?  What do you work on specifically?  What do you enjoy, what don't you like?
* If you think the team could change one thing, what would it be?  (This will need to be a real answer, not "better coffee" :D)
* How do you like to receive feedback? - For instance: immediately in person, or email first and then in person or some other way
* What's your favorite way to celebrate?  For both large and small (i.e. dinner with team, wine tasting in Napa, bowling, bocce etc)
* How do you like to be recognized?  In front of the team, through a celebration, personally in private, special personalized gift?
* When do you like to do 1x1s?  Morning, afternoon, any particular days you prefer, Monday vs Friday?
* Do you have hobbies outside of work?
* What's your favorite dessert?

## Recurring

These are usually weekly, same time, same day, typically 45-60 mins and saved for direct reports.  The direct report should bring the agenda as its a way to cover relevant topics.  However, I do have a sample format I use that typically helps guide the conversation and focus in on key things.

### Sample Format

* Check in
  * Did you do anything fun last week?
  * what did you work on last week that made you happy?
  * What drained your energy or annoyed you?
* Goals Update (for example OKR check-ins)
  * How is the work driving KRs?
  * Are there other things you think we should work on?
* Feedback
  * What are things I am doing that is helping you do your job?
  * What are things I am doing that is hindering you?
* IDP (individual development plan)
  * What did you work on last week that helped with your growth plan?
