# 1x1s

1x1s is the most important tool for a people leader.  There are actually several kinds I've used to build strong relationships and help grow my teammates.

## Getting to know you

Whenever I take on a new team or hire a new employee, I use this.  I consider this a very special 1x1 because its when you can make your first impression as a leader and set the tone for the relationship moving forward.  I always come from a place of caring of the whole self.
